# Table of Contents

# SvelteKit Fundamentals

1.  **Introduction**
    *   Before we begin
        *   This section is a brief note to the reader, encouraging them to seek help if they get stuck
    *   What is SvelteKit?
        *   A high-level overview of SvelteKit, emphasizing its role as a framework for building web applications with Svelte. It highlights its features like routing, build optimizations, and server-side rendering. It can be considered Svelte's equivalent to Next.js(React) and Nuxt.js (Vue).
    *   What is Svelte?
        *   Explains Svelte as a UI component framework. Mentions the compiler which turns components into vanilla JS and CSS. It mentions the core use case for Svelte as a framework to build user interfaces for the browser
    *   SvelteKit vs Svelte
        *   Differentiates Svelte (UI library) from SvelteKit (application framework). It explains that SvelteKit builds on top of Svelte, adding a router and other features needed to build a full web application. It highlights that SvelteKit helps you build modern applications while providing the best practices for routing, preloading, SSR, image optimization and so on.

2.  **Creating a project**
    *   Editor setup
        *   Recommends using VS Code with the Svelte extension but also mentions support for other editors.
    *   Project structure
        *   Describes the file system and organization of a typical SvelteKit project
            *   Project Files
                *   `src`
                    *   `lib`: Contains reusable library code.
                        * `server` contains server-only library code that cannot be used on the client.
                    *   `params`: Contains parameter matching logic that modifies how SvelteKit resolves routes.
                    *   `routes`: Contains all the files that represent the different routes and pages of your application.
                    *   `app.html`: The template for pages (HTML file with placeholders for SvelteKit to inject head and body).
                    *   `error.html`: The template for the fallback error page shown when something unexpected occurs.
                    *   `hooks.client.js`:  Client hooks (code that runs before the app is initialized in the browser).
                    *   `hooks.server.js`: Server hooks (code that runs on the server before responding to a request).
                    *   `service-worker.js`: Your application service worker, if you have one.
                *   `static`: Location for static assets (e.g. `robots.txt`, favicons).
                *   `tests`: Location for end-to-end tests, created by playwright.
                *   `package.json`: Used to manage and configure the project, including dependencies, scripts, and project metadata.
                *   `svelte.config.js`: Used to set up Svelte/SvelteKit-specific configurations such as custom elements, prerendering, and more.
                *   `tsconfig.json`: Used to configure TypeScript-specific settings such as type checking, and target language.
                *   `vite.config.js`: Used to configure Vite, which SvelteKit uses internally for bundling your application.
            *   Other files
                *   `.svelte-kit`: SvelteKit's build output and generated files. Should be ignored and is safe to delete since it is created automatically when you run `dev` or `build`.

3.  **Web standards in SvelteKit**
    *   Fetch APIs
        *   Request
            *   Describes the `Request` object available in SvelteKit, with information about the incoming requests that are used for routing and data loading.
        *   Response
            *   Describes the `Response` objects that are returned from SvelteKit server-side code, defining the output from the server.
        *   Headers
            *   Explains the `Headers` object and how it allows you to access and modify headers of `Request` and `Response` objects.
    *   FormData
        *   Describes how to use the `FormData` object to manage and read data that's sent to your application via HTML forms.
    *   Stream APIs
        *   Briefly introduces the concept of streams (`ReadableStream`, `WritableStream`, `TransformStream`) in JavaScript, which allow you to work with data in chunks without keeping it all in memory at once.

            *   Explains how to fetch data for a layout component with `+layout.js` and how data is passed down to all child routes.
        *   `+layout.server.js`
            *   Explains that `+layout.server.js` is a server-side-only version of `+layout.js` where server-side data fetching and processing is done.
    *   `+server`
        *   Describes the `+server.js` files and how to create API endpoints, which can be used for handling data requests
            *   Receiving data

            *   Content negotiation
               *  Explains how SvelteKit determines if it should serve a page or an API endpoint based on the `accept` header and the presence of `+page` and `+server.js` files in the same folder.
    *   `$types`
        *   Briefly explains the generated `$types` directory and `d.ts` files which provide type-safe interfaces for data loaded in `+page` and `+layout` files. It mentions that you can omit these for now and they are automatically added by your editor.
    *   Other files
        *  Explains that other files in a route folder that do not match the special `+`-prefixed filenames are ignored by SvelteKit. These can be used for helper functions, components, and more.

    *   Encoding
         * Describes the URL encoding to use for file names that contain special characters, which are needed by the operating system to use as filenames (such as `/`, `:`, `*`, `[`, `]` ,`(`, `)`, and others).
    *   Advanced layouts
        *   (group)
            *   Explains layout groups, which allow you to group layouts and pages together using parentheses to make file structure cleaner and easier to reason about.

        *   Explains how load functions can return promises that are streamed as they resolve, and how it helps the application's perceived performance.
    *   Parallel loading
        * Explains how load functions run concurrently, which prevents waterfalls of requests.
    *    Rerunning load functions
          * Describes how SvelteKit tracks dependencies in load functions and which factors can trigger a rerun (e.g. changing a route parameter) and how to invalidate data manually.
    *    Implications for authentication
          * Discusses potential strategies and implications of loading data within a route when authentication is involved.
    *   Further reading

            *   Custom event listener
                *   Explains how to use HTML event listeners on forms to perform form actions without using `use:enhance`
    *   Alternatives
        *   Briefly describes the alternative approach of using `+server.js` endpoints.
    *   GET vs POST
        * Explains that GET forms trigger client-side navigation rather than server-side action, but they will invoke load functions
    *   Further reading
