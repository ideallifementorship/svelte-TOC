# SvelteKit Fundamentals

1.  **Introduction**
    *   Before we begin
        *   This section is a brief note to the reader, encouraging them to seek help if they get stuck
    *   What is SvelteKit?
        *   A high-level overview of SvelteKit, emphasizing its role as a framework for building web applications with Svelte. It highlights its features like routing, build optimizations, and server-side rendering. It can be considered Svelte's equivalent to Next.js(React) and Nuxt.js (Vue).
    *   What is Svelte?
        *   Explains Svelte as a UI component framework. Mentions the compiler which turns components into vanilla JS and CSS. It mentions the core use case for Svelte as a framework to build user interfaces for the browser
    *   SvelteKit vs Svelte
        *   Differentiates Svelte (UI library) from SvelteKit (application framework). It explains that SvelteKit builds on top of Svelte, adding a router and other features needed to build a full web application. It highlights that SvelteKit helps you build modern applications while providing the best practices for routing, preloading, SSR, image optimization and so on.

2.  **Creating a project**
    *   Editor setup
        *   Recommends using VS Code with the Svelte extension but also mentions support for other editors.
    *   Project structure
        *   Describes the file system and organization of a typical SvelteKit project
            *   Project Files
                *   `src`
                    *   `lib`: Contains reusable library code.
                        * `server` contains server-only library code that cannot be used on the client.
                    *   `params`: Contains parameter matching logic that modifies how SvelteKit resolves routes.
                    *   `routes`: Contains all the files that represent the different routes and pages of your application.
                    *   `app.html`: The template for pages (HTML file with placeholders for SvelteKit to inject head and body).
                    *   `error.html`: The template for the fallback error page shown when something unexpected occurs.
                    *   `hooks.client.js`:  Client hooks (code that runs before the app is initialized in the browser).
                    *   `hooks.server.js`: Server hooks (code that runs on the server before responding to a request).
                    *   `service-worker.js`: Your application service worker, if you have one.
                *   `static`: Location for static assets (e.g. `robots.txt`, favicons).
                *   `tests`: Location for end-to-end tests, created by playwright.
                *   `package.json`: Used to manage and configure the project, including dependencies, scripts, and project metadata.
                *   `svelte.config.js`: Used to set up Svelte/SvelteKit-specific configurations such as custom elements, prerendering, and more.
                *   `tsconfig.json`: Used to configure TypeScript-specific settings such as type checking, and target language.
                *   `vite.config.js`: Used to configure Vite, which SvelteKit uses internally for bundling your application.
            *   Other files
                *   `.svelte-kit`: SvelteKit's build output and generated files. Should be ignored and is safe to delete since it is created automatically when you run `dev` or `build`.

3.  **Web standards in SvelteKit**
    *   Fetch APIs

            *   Content negotiation
                 * Explains how SvelteKit determines if it should serve a page or an API endpoint based on the `accept` header and the presence of `+page` and `+server.js` files in the same folder.
    *   `$types`
        *   Briefly explains the generated `$types` directory and `d.ts` files which provide type-safe interfaces for data loaded in `+page` and `+layout` files. It mentions that you can omit these for now and they are automatically added by your editor.
    *   Other files
        *  Explains that other files in a route folder that do not match the special `+`-prefixed filenames are ignored by SvelteKit. These can be used for helper functions, components, and more.
